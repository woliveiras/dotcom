Senior Software Engineer with experience working with and leading the software architecture, software design, and implementation of frontend applications, UI components (development, test, maintenance, and evolution), and frontend libraries, whether theyâ€™re end-users or software developers.

Working with frontend development since 2014. I started with jQuery, Angular.js (1x) and like the possibilities to work with performance, accessibility and software architecture for the web. I have experience with React, Nex.js, React Testing Library, Jest, AWS, Drone and CircleCI, ArgoCD, NX (monorepos), styled-components, and Material UI.

Hello, my friend, I am William Oliveira. Frontend Software Engineer or Web Engineer as you wish. I'm writing this article so that we can get to know each other. Also, feel comfortable sharing your history with me on my Twitter: [@1ilhas](https://twitter.com/1ilhas).

I started to work with technology on technical support (helpdesk) in 2011. I've always been in love with technology. So, I started my plan to work with it in 2008. And after two years of working in the helpdesk, I moved to system administration. But I always have been curious about software development. That was my first goal when I started to learn about technology, but, because of social problems, I cannot do this.

The distance between companies of software development, or whatever having software development jobs, and the impossibility to do a university (because I worked in other things before my tech career) was a great wall in my way. I always have the facility with technology, so I only needed an opportunity to enter this area. And it's happened! In 2014, I got my first opportunity as a software engineer. And this changed all my perspectives and goals for the future.

After my change from system administration to software development, I never stop working with this. I love the software development lifecycle and everything involved in this process. I like to understand the need of my stakeholder, and split the tasks into small pieces, after that, I love to transform the idea into genuine software in production. If you don't work in software development, it's like getting raw materials and transforming them into some tangible. This is fantastic bro!

In the beginning, I worked as a full-stack software engineer using PHP, MySQL, Apache, and Linux, the classical web development stack called LAMP. But, after a few months, I have my first contact with modern frontend development with Angular.js. This was mindblowing to me. I have learned about mobile software development (at that time how to create apps for Symbian OS), and the challenges of this application design, and when I saw the frontend coming in a similar way, I liked it.

I started to specialize in frontend in 2016. When a friend showed me the power of thinking in accessibility, I discovered that my way was to the frontend. And I followed this path. On the front/client side of software development, I can focus on usability, working on application performance, accessibility, and application security. Yes! The backend people can work with accessibility or usability too, but in the frontend, this is not a plus, it is the minimum of my work. We have a lot of similarities in backend and frontend development, like software scalability, software quality, system design, and other stuff, but I like the approach of work in the application that will run on the face of my user and improve the experience to the best possible experience.

In this blog, I'll share things about frontend software development and software architecture in general. I want you to have a good experience reading my words and supporting your daily. See you in the next post.
